my first quarter at lowood seemed an age and not the golden age either it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks the fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot though these were no trifles during january february and part of march the deep snows and after their melting the almost impassable roads prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls except to go to church but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold we had no boots the snow got into our shoes and melted there our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains as were our feet i remember well the distracting irritation i endured from this cause every evening when my feet inflamed and the torture of thrusting the swelled raw and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning then the scanty supply of food was distressing with the keen appetites of growing children we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalidfrom this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse which pressed hardly on the younger pupils whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion many a time i have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at teatime and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee i have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears forced from me by the exigency of hungersundays were dreary days in that wintry season we had to walk two miles to brocklebridge church where our patron officiated we set out cold we arrived at church colder during the morning service we became almost paralysed it was too far to return to dinner and an allowance of cold meat and bread in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals was served round between the servicesat the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road where the bitter winter wind blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north almost flayed the skin from our facesi can remember miss temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line her plaid cloak which the frosty wind fluttered gathered close about her and encouraging us by precept and example to keep up our spirits and march forward as she said like stalwart soldiers the other teachers poor things were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering othershow we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back but to the little ones at least this was denied each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls and behind them the younger children crouched in groups wrapping their starved arms in their pinaforesa little solace came at teatime in the shape of a double ration of bread a whole instead of a half slice with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from sabbath to sabbath i generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself but the remainder i was invariably obliged to part withthe sunday evening was spent in repeating by heart the church catechism and the fifth sixth and seventh chapters of st matthew and in listening to a long sermon read by miss miller whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness a frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of eutychus by some halfdozen of little girls who overpowered with sleep would fall down if not out of the third loft yet off the fourth form and be taken up half dead the remedy was to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished sometimes their feet failed them and they sank together in a heap they were then propped up with the monitors high stoolsi have not yet alluded to the visits of mr brocklehurst and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon his absence was a relief to me i need not say that i had my own reasons for dreading his coming but come he did at lastone afternoon i had then been three weeks at lowood as i was sitting with a slate in my hand puzzling over a sum in long division my eyes raised in abstraction to the window caught sight of a figure just passing i recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline and when two minutes after all the school teachers included rose en masse it was not  necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted a long stride measured the schoolroom and presently beside miss temple who herself had risen stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of gateshead i now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture yes i was right it was mr brocklehurst buttoned up in a surtout and looking longer narrower and more rigid than everi had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition too well i remembered the perfidious hints given by mrs reed about my disposition etc the promise pledged by mr brocklehurst to apprise miss temple and the teachers of my vicious nature all along i had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise i had been looking out daily for the coming man whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever now there he washe stood at miss temples side he was speaking low in her ear i did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy and i watched her eye with painful anxiety expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt i listened too and as i happened to be seated quite at the top of the room i caught most of what he said its import relieved me from immediate apprehensioni suppose miss temple the thread i bought at lowton will do it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises and i sorted the needles to match you may tell miss smith that i forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles but she shall have some papers sent in next week and she is not on any account to give out more than one at a time to each pupil if they have more they are apt to be careless and lose them and o maam i wish the woollen stockings were better looked to when i was here last i went into the kitchengarden and examined the clothes drying on the line there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair from the size of the holes in them i was sure they had not been well mended from time to time he pausedyour directions shall be attended to sir said miss temple and maam he continued the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week it is too much the rules limit them to onei think i can explain that circumstance sir agnes and catherine johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at lowton last thursday and i gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasionmr brocklehurst noddedwell for once it may pass but please not to let the circumstance occur too often and there is another thing which surprised me i find in settling accounts with the housekeeper that a lunch consisting of bread and cheese has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight how is this i looked over the regulations and i find no such meal as lunch mentioned who introduced this innovation and by what authorityi must be responsible for the circumstance sir replied miss temple the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it and i dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinnertimemadam allow me an instant you are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence but to render them hardy patient selfdenying should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur such as the spoiling of a meal the under or the over dressing of a dish the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils by encouraging them to evince fortitude under the temporary privation a brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive christians to the torments of martyrs to the exhortations of our blessed lord himself calling upon his disciples to take up their cross and follow him to his warnings that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god to his divine consolations if ye suffer hunger or thirst for my sake happy are ye oh madam when you put bread and cheese instead of burnt porridge into these childrens mouths you may indeed feed their vile bodies but you little think how you starve their immortal soulsmr brocklehurst again paused perhaps overcome by his feelings miss temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her but she now gazed straight before her and her face naturally pale as marble appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material especially her mouth closed as if it would have required a sculptors chisel to open it and her brow settled gradually into petrified severitymeantime mr brocklehurst standing on the hearth with his hands behind his back majestically surveyed the whole school suddenly his eye gave a blink as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil turning he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto usedmiss temple miss temple what what is that girl with curled hair red hair maam curled curled all over and extending his cane he pointed to the awful object his hand shaking as he did soit is julia severn replied miss temple very quietlyjulia severn maam and why has she or any other curled hair why in defiance of every precept and principle of this house does she conform to the world so openly here in an evangelical charitable establishment as to wear her hair one mass of curlsjulias hair curls naturally returned miss temple still more quietlynaturally yes but we are not to conform to nature i wish these girls to be the children of grace and why that abundance i have again and again intimated that i desire the hair to be arranged closely modestly plainly miss temple that girls hair must be cut off entirely i will send a barber tomorrow and i see others who have far too much of the excrescence that tall girl tell her to turn round tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall
